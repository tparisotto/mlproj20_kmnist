# Machine Learning Project 2019/2020

The code is a series of classifiers which i have commented to avoid running them all at once, to experiment with a classifier uncomment its section and run:
'''
python3 main.py
'''
The analysis on the data has been performed with
'''
python3 analysis.py
'''
In the same way, I commented most of the code, so interested sections have to be uncommented and run.
